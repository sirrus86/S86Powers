	 * Field values from the power class can be inserted into the description by surrounding the field name in brackets. For example, if you have the field {@code int test = 5}, then by having the description say "There are [test] dollars in my wallet", it will be read in-game as "There are 5 dollars in my wallet".
	 * <p>
	 * The following field types are currently supported:<ul>
	 * <li>{@code boolean} - Text between [field] and [/field] will only display if the boolean value is true. To have text appear if the field is false you must create a dedicated field.
	 * <li>{@code ItemStack} - Text [item] is displayed as a user-friendly name for the item. [act:item] will display "left-click" or "right-click" depending on which action is appropriate for the specified item.
	 * <li>{@code long} - Text [long] is displayed as a user-friendly representation of the amount of time this field is set to. For example, {@code long time = PowerTime.toMillis(1, 30, 0)} would display [time] as "1 minute 30 seconds".
	 * </ul>
	 * All other field types are displayed as {@link Object#toString()}.
